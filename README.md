## Network port scanner ##

## Objective

The Network port scanner project aimed to establish a foundational understanding of network communication and security reconnnaissance by building a simple TCP port scanner in python. The tool demonstrates the principles of the TCP threeway handshake and shows how to identify open ports on a target system, which is a key step in vulnerability assessment.

### Skills Learned


- Development of practical python scripting skills.
- Gaining hands on experience with socket programming to establish network connections.
- Enhanced knowledge of network fundamentals and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used


- Python's socket library.
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Text editor

## Step by step implementation

Step 1: open your code editor and create a new python file
Step 2: import socket library
